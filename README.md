# IoT Device with Custom Firmware for Secure Wi-Fi Connectivity

Develop a custom firmware for an ESP32 or STM32-based IoT device to connect securely to AWS IoT Core using the 802.11 security model (WPA2/WPA3).

## Components

1. ESP32 (or STM32 with an external Wi-Fi module like ESP8266)
2. AWS IoT Core account
3. Arduino IDE (for ESP32) or STM32CubeIDE (for STM32)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up AWS IoT Core

Log in to your AWS account and navigate to AWS IoT Core.
Create a new Thing, download the certificates (device certificate, private key, and root CA), and attach a policy that allows the Thing to connect and publish to MQTT topics.

### 2. Configure the ESP32 (Arduino) or STM32 (STM32CubeMX)

#### 2.1 ESP32

Install the ESP32 board in the Arduino IDE.
Install the WiFiClientSecure library for secure communication.
Write a basic sketch to connect to your Wi-Fi network using WPA2.

#### 2.2 STM32

Use STM32CubeMX to configure UART for communication with an external ESP8266 module.
Implement AT commands in C++ to establish a secure connection (WPA2) and communicate with AWS IoT.

### 3. Implement Secure Connection to AWS IoT

Program the ESP32 to connect securely using the WiFiClientSecure library and MQTT.
On STM32, use the ESP8266â€™s AT command set to establish a TLS connection.

### 4. Test the Secure Connection

Monitor the AWS IoT Core MQTT client to ensure the device is securely publishing messages.
Use Wireshark to analyze the packet flow and verify secure communication.

### 5. Deploy and Scale

Once verified, deploy the firmware to multiple devices and manage them via AWS IoT Device Management.
